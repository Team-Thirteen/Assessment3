    <h3>Team Overall Summary</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="mainPageParagraph">
    <p>By reviewing all our personal tests, we can see where other members in our team lack and where others are strong. This allows the team to delegate appropriately allowing the team members to work in areas where they are strong and excel in. It also allows the team to build structure by appointing team leaders who will take charge and delegate as well as giving everyone a place in the team where they are comfortable. All these things lead to a great team and allow for the completion of the assignment to the highest standard. </p>
