                    So, I'm what's called a scrum master. I coach teams of software engineers and so my job is to make sure they are working at their best performance, by putting in behaviors and practices that help them collaborate and work better together.      
                </p>

                <p>
                    I work for Vodafone. we have our own network across Europe and the world. Providing telecommunications networks for consumers and businesses. We are building the digital transformation from bricks and mortar sales to online sales, so moving everything from our traditional shop-based business to having and much stronger digital presence. We are moving towards a more cloud and DevOps culture and all that kind of business so that we can really automate everything and have everything as a digital first business. So, there's a massive amount of transformation. I am also more specifically working on the business side of things where we're providing a business end portal for customers to buy our business sales products, which is things like if you are a company that wants to have fiber networks, we will provide it for you through various resellers or systems

                <p>
                    A lot of what I am doing at the moment, as well as coaching is basically supporting the organization to bring in demand. So, when people want us to build specific things for the website across 6-7 teams or whatever, we have to kind of turn that ask into something that our engineers can execute. So, we take all the requirements, all the kind of outcomes that they expect and break it down into deliverables that we can work on.

                <p>
                    I am a Scrum master in a scrum team, so developers, testers, UX designers, architects and product owners, (which are the people who specify the requirements) and the people they report to, so business stakeholders and customers. You then have more senior management we talk to, also reporting up the chain so engineering managers and customer managers. We create a platform that sells products. Those products have sales managers, so we often talk to them. Also, tech support and all these kinds of people as well. So quite a diverse mix.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We work in two-week cycles known as sprints, so the various events throughout that allows me to interact with other IT professionals. The main thing is that we have a daily standard meeting which is every 15 minutes. Everyone gets together, shares what they did yesterday and shares what they're trying to achieve today and then kind of raises any issues that they're having. We talk about how to improve as a team. We output demonstrations to businesses, so lots of formal interactions. All interactions, at the moment, are online instead of office, due to covid. We use slack messaging, which acts a kind of backbone to our working. Its more convenient as people are based in different locations. Interactions have become better; we can use online tools that can be saved instead of a whiteboard. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We have a product person on the team and his job is to work with the stakeholders and subject matter experts to talk about what the product is. My interaction is generally through support and aid with organizing, facilitating meetings, and that sort of thing. I make sure any kind of communications as well are being managed. 

                    I worked for McLaren for 9 years and it was totally different because I was dealing with race engineers and people using our hardware in the field at a racetrack.

                <p>
                    Yeah, at the moment generally organizational work. So, at the moment we're planning to do a quarterly planning session every three months and put that into practice. Making sure that everyone is aligned and ready to do some planning in a way that the plan is consistent and liked by the business, that's kind of my main focus. Also making sure everyone's accurate and as transparent as possible and working in an organized way throughout the quarter. So, we are tracking delivery and progress. I have 3 teams to manage, so it's a kind of balancing act between making sure my teams ok versus makes sure the organization is ok. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Influencing people is a big challenge. Everyone has their own point of view, including me and I think the biggest challenge is not so much telling them what they should be doing, but listening and trying to make sure that you can carry on with what you want to do whilst at the same time including them and not just pushing them out. Therefore, influencing them so they can do things in your way and work with you rather than it being antagonistic, which is always the challenge.  

 

                    You've got a lot of different people with different needs and differences. There is a lot of pressure on them, so I think you really have to sit back and understand that. You are making sure they are listening to what you are saying and making sure that you don’t just kind of railroad them into your way of thinking, just to get what you want done. But the same time keeping the integrity of what we do.

                    Starts by showing the Azure DevOps Kanban Board… So, one of the things we are working with day to day is Azure DevOps, which is a Microsoft product. It’s an Agile environment hosted in the cloud. We start sprints in columns and people pull the tasks into active and once it’s done it gets reviewed and tested.  

 

                    Once that's done it'll get reviewed and tested and will move into QA, which is where our testers are testing the program in a more realistic approach. Our product owner (stakeholder) will review it and will like it or won’t like it with added comments. It then gets released into production or it gets blocked If there's any issues. Once it's done, it goes into the closed columns, so that's kind of how we work.  
                    
                    Generally, people (developers) collaborate on them (tasks in the Kanban board), and the numbers allocated to the tasks are sizes. So, we don't give estimates in terms of time, we give it in terms of complexity. So, five is more complex than a three, which is more complex than two. It's all relative, it's just that kind of gut feeling where how big you think it is, and to measure that over the course of the sprint. We measure how many points we did and that sprint plus the average, and that's what we used to plan the next sprint. That's basically what the team uses to track, plan and manage their work on a day-to-day basis. The Point here is Matthew is showing how DevOps fosters a collaborative approach to software development and how cloud technology has helps with this. Its this collaborative approach that is part of the essence of the IT industry.

                    Slack is a messaging program that is used for channels for teams. The teams use it to chat, banter and also use it to message for help. Help meetings can be created if people get stuck. The use of share screens, debugging programs help to solve issues. We encourage paired and mob programming and people to work together, so there is more knowledge. We have mob sessions where teams work on one problem. People look at code for mistakes and suggestions for improvements, mob programming results in getting more done, as more brains are on one thing. We want the whole team working efficiently, more people result in better quality, no bugs, and less testing

                    The project I am most proud of is Providing engine control units for all f1 teams when I was at McLaren. It was a massive deal and was politically challenging with having to deal with all formula one teams. We had to make sure the data was being logged in a standard way and teams had the right transparency and the right control over it, so we had to be really trusted by our customers and the other formula one teams. So, doing that, getting it all done for the start of the race testing season, then obviously into racing with was challenging. I think we had like one failure over like 2 years. It was technically a really good thing

                <p>
                    I did a computer science. I took a gap year when I was 19, which is good and then that led onto my first job which was a graduate job. So, I moved down to work for a company called kinetic. It did defense research, so working on navigation systems for military helicopters and stuff like that. So that's quite cool, and I did that for a couple years.  

 

                    I picked up some skills in automated testing that we're kind of new at the time, and as a result got the job at McLaren and I was there for nine years. 
                    
                    So, from there I progressed from tester to test lead to team lead. Realized that because of the way the way the organizing was, there wasn't much room for growth beyond that. So, I decided to look around left McLaren and then worked for a company called BAE Systems a defense company, I did that for like 18 months. I then moved in with my partner in Bracknell, which is an hour commuting to London on the train. So, I got fed up with that and then decided I wanted to merge work close to home. So then looking around the Vodafone job came up and that was a good time to join. Yeah, I think It's been quite an interesting career. A lot of luck and chance.

                    Learning is constant throughout industry, so even if you are a Java developer, you'll always be learning. That's the main thing you will find out is that the skills change completely, all the time. So what people were doing when I left university is completely different to how people write code now. The main skill is to keep learning and the energy to keep learning new skills and to get on top of it, doing one thing can get you stuck, it’s all evolving and will be different in 20 years. The skill to have is learning, you need to keep in front of it and your degree is the start not the completion.

                    Definitely, cloud based. Continuing to build on that, I think there's no going back from that. I think that technology, I mean, it depends how into the future because Facebook are looking at MSR and Metaverse kind of stuff. I think that's going to be something quite big it, especially if people keep remote working. What kind of things become virtual environments and that kind of stuff?  We've got a lot of stuff coming online for 5G which will change things again, because of being able to do things at high speed over remote locations. I think it's difficult to really say what we will be doing, but we can suggest that certain knowledge will be important, and I think that those things are very important and we're applying the pressure, the virtual world, and high-speed remote networks so you know, being able to do things like surgery remotely and stuff like that. Or have automated control of cars and things like that and all these kind of different technologies

                <p>
                    I don't think you should discriminate. I think learning to program, once you learn understand how programming works, you will pick up languages fairly, easily. So, Java is a good place to start. All languages are pretty good, once you learn the concepts of programming most languages are similar, as long, as it makes sense when you are doing it. Java Script is a bit limited but powerful, you should learn bits and pieces as you go on, you should also look at stuff for AI, try everything and try complex stuff. You can’t go too wrong, as long, as you are understanding programming vs understanding a code. People get comfortable doing a specific one, but as long, as it’s the right tool for the job. If you're learning and understanding the mechanics of programming, then picking up a new language is fairly, straightforward. I mean like C# and Java, and so forth, it's syntactically all very similar.

        <button class="accordion">I know you are a scrum master, what is scrum and how rigidly do you adhere to its methodology?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="question1">
                
                <p>
                    Scrum is an approach to organizing teams around a collective goal, and the idea is that you do some work. You reflect on it and then you re-plan it. It’s not a software approach but an organizational approach for our team to work effectively. The idea is that you do some work, you share that work that you've done with stakeholders, organizations, your team, and you reflect on it and use the output of that work to decide what to do next. 

 

                    So traditionally projects would require you to go and build some code for six months to twelve months and then at the end of that period if you realize it's wrong, it could be disastrous and is a bad way of doing things.  
                    
                     
                    
                    We plan to do some of the requirements, deliver it to the customer and get the feedback more quickly so we can evolve and become better at it as a team. We provide working code that you demonstrate and show to the customer where they can go and use it, it helps keep people in the loop. It also helps put the control into the team’s hands.

                    Good thing about Cloud computing is scale. If there is more traffic it automatically scales. For example, at Vodafone the iPhone release is always the biggest thing in the calendar. The massive increase can be automatically scaled up. Last release, we had people on call to help, but not one person got contacted. The cloud is massively important for every business, it helps make data available everywhere and people can work from any computer in the world. Cloud computing is part of the future of what we do. While I was at Maclaren data had to go to local storage and then be transported, it can now go straight to the cloud using 5G in real time. Companies and businesses don’t have to invest in servers they don’t want, it allows small services to access big infrastructure. Cloud computing is the future, it’s the best and a cost-effective way to do it and allows for better collaboration.
