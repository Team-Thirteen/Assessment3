            <p>It’s no surprise that Communication skills rank number 1 on the Burning Glass Generals Skills graph above. Employers need people who can effectively communicate with in teams. Looking at the Job descriptions five out of the six job specifications require this skill so it would pay to develop this soft skill. <br><br>Problem solving skills are 2nd over all but only two of the six job specs have requested this. That said given the nature of IT work I’d say this is a pre-requisite of any IT role. Writing is 4th overall and 3rd in our skill sets this could be down to documenting system details in terms legacy. Teamwork / Collaboration very important especially on software teams working with Agile frameworks like scrum.</p>

            <p>Project Management is a specific role within the IT industry which no one in the team has chosen as an Ideal job. Although some personal project management will be required for each of the it would generally be required for a specific role. <br><br>SAP stands for Systems Applications and Products in Data Processing. It is also the name of a company a software company that specialises in ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) software. It’s quite specific and would generally be a specialisation for anyone using it. <br><br>Business management - unsurprisingly no one has a role that specifies Business management this would generally be a progression from development work to perhaps management although having an understanding of the type of business you are in as an IT professional is a must</p>

            <p>Organisational Skills - will likely be the domain of business leaders such as project Managers and Business Analysts in most IT teams. Its perhaps not overall a necessary skill for our job specifications but being organised at your job level is advantageous. <br><br>Planning - again this would be a skill required of business leaders as above. <br><br>Creativity - you’d argue that all professions require an element of creativity especially development roles were getting jiggy with code might mean the difference between a good product or not. I’d say however this skill in terms of job postings would be reserved for the creative types such as UI/UX and graphic Designers. </p>
